## Handlebars Template CLI

Uses handlebars template language to allow you add template variables to files and then dynamically replace them via the command line or via an input json or yaml file and then output the results to a file or stdout.

Very useful for build environments that need to change off of data.

Uses handlebars since it's the most widely used for Rust code and works well in a server and client environment (using javascript).
